# @shopify/theme-cart

## Getting Started

Theme Scripts can be used in any theme project. To take advantage of semantic versioning and easy updates, we recommend using NPM or Yarn to include them in your project:

```
yarn add @shopify/theme-cart
```

and then import the functions you wish to use through ES6 imports:

```
import * as cart from '@shopify/theme-cart`;
```

If you prefer not to use a package manager, you can download the latest version of Theme Cart and include it in your project manually from the following links:

- [theme-cart.js](http://unpkg.com/@shopify/theme-cart@latest/dist/theme-cart.js)
- [theme-cart.min.js](http://unpkg.com/@shopify/theme-cart@latest/dist/theme-cart.min.js)

These files make Theme cart accessible via the `Shopify.theme.cart` global variable.
